## Reflection
On Tuesday, 17 December 2024, I had the opportunity to visit an IT industry for the first time. It was a great experience. I was impressed by the company’s modern facilities and the warm welcome from the staff. The environment was both professional and inviting. All the staff were friendly and kind, showing us many places inside UTM Digital, such as the UTM Digital Centre. Besides, they provided us with valuable insights into their operations and innovative practices. It was fascinating to see how they work, and I found it very inspiring.
