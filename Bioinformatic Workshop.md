On 10 January 2025, i had attend an online bioinformatic workshop, this workshop gave a talk about what job can a bioinformatic student get after graduate. They brief detailly each scope for a specific job. For example, data scientist. They gave us lots of guide how to become closer with our dream job. We need to learn all AI methods for allowing comprehensive analysis that leverages the strength of both AI and bioinformatics.

From this workshop, i got to enhance my knowledge more about my course. Besides, it also managed to open my eyes about the opportunities in this field. It give me a motivation to persuade my dream to become a data analysis. Thus, I'm planning to improve my potential in the industry by joining as many of the programs provided by my faculty as I can or join any talk related to my course. Besides, I also want to take part and be a participant in every competition that was related to AI or coding. Within this approach, I can widen my connection with people surrounding and enhance my programming skills in languages. In addition, I want to enroll in advanced courses and obtain certifications related to my course, data science and computational biology. For example, Google and AI certificates. This is because it helps me to stay updated with the latest trends and technologies.
