Hello, I am a Science Computer student specializing in bioinformatics. As a bioinformatics student, I merge the realms of biology and computer science. Currently, i had learned a C++ language where it was my first learned-language. I thrive on curiosity and love learning about the biology and also the new language in programming. My ambition is to become an analytic data so that i can uncover the mysteries within biological data.
