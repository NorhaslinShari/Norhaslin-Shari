On 27 October 2024, my team and i were given project by our lecturer in subject Technology and Information System. This project called Design Thinking assignment where we were given a specific theme 
which is innovation for disadvantage group. We all gather together and each members gave their own idea, hence we combine all the idea by using five key steps which is empathize, define, ideate,
prototype and test and finally come out with Physicovery app. This app were aim to launch in the future to improve the quality of life for individuals with physical disabilities. Our main goal is to
help and support disadvantage people on their recovery journey through the innovation solutions provided by our app.

### Reflection
 First and foremost, design thinking greatly affects my aspirations especially in the bioinformatics industry by offering an organized method for creativity and problem-solving. These five methods—empathy, 
 definition, ideation, prototyping, and testing—are part of design thinking. All these approaches are crucial since they can help me learn more about the issue. For example, brainstorming to get an idea 
 about developing an app, do a critical thinking to analysis something and produce a prototype to implement my idea. Additionally, design thinking gives me the ability to approach issues systematically and 
 creatively, guaranteeing that the solutions I create are creative, user-centered, and efficient. It offers a structure that precisely matches my goals in bioinformatics and computer science, assisting me
 in realizing my aspirations to use technology to advance scientific research and healthcare. Additionally, it allows me to demonstrate my ability to tackle any issue by carefully and thoroughly analyzing it.
 Thus, we sincerely hope that our concept for the Physicovery App can create a significant positive impact on individuals in need of physical therapy. By providing an accessible, innovative, and personalized
 platform, we aim to empower users to take control of their recovery journey, reduce pain, and improve their quality of life.
